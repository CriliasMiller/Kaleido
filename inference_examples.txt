A cartoon figure with long blonde pigtails leaps playfully on a vast, fluffy pink cloud. Her pink, star-adorned cape billows with the movement, and her chunky boots press into the soft surface with each bounce. The butterfly charm on her necklace sways as she lands and springs up again, a determined expression on her face.@@resources/ref1.png
In a sun-drenched attic, a fox character in a green coat carefully pushes a vintage toy car across the dusty wooden floor. Seated in the driver's seat of the tiny car is a small penguin plush toy, its blue beanie askew as it wobbles with the movement. The fox gives the car one final, gentle push, sending it rolling slowly toward a ramp made from a stack of old books. The car, with the penguin plush toy inside, smoothly glides up the ramp and comes to a stop at the top.@@resources/ref2.png@@resources/ref3.png
